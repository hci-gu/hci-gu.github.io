The division started in the\n        summer of 2019 and is currently expanding, focusing on becoming an\n        important player within research, education, and collaboration at the\n        University of Gothenburg. A big focus area for the division is health\n        and well-being, an example of a project here is ”Digital seniors” which\n        focuses on the growing group of older people who have been actively\n        using computers for a long time – digital seniors.\n        <br></br>\n        <h2>The internship</h2>\n        We are currently looking for interns for Autumn 2020 for a duration of{' '}\n        <strong>_WEEKS_</strong> weeks with start date on{' '}\n        <strong>_DATE_</strong>. The internship will revolve around the theme\n        exploring technology, where you will pick an area to focus on and\n        together with our division explore it through experimenting and\n        developing applications within that space.\n        <br></br>\n        <br></br>\n        The internship will provide opportunities to work together with our\n        division on a daily basis and get practical experience working on\n        research projects. The tasks themselves might vary depending on the\n        project but will include things such as:\n        <br></br>\n        <br></br>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Programming research prototypes and tools for research. </li>\n          <li>\n            Work closely and take part in daily meetings and work discussions\n            with the division.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Participate in seminars and other events organized by division of\n            HCI and the University.\n          </li>\n          <li>Conduct research, collect and analyze data </li>\n        </ul>\n        For the division, the internship is a way to both further explore\n        different technologies, as well as dive deeper into our focus areas. Our\n        main focus area is health and well-being. We want to explore ways of\n        understanding how technology affects our well-being. This includes\n        mindfulness, physical health, etc. One area we want to explore connected\n        to this is hydroponics and gardening, and how it connects to how we live\n        with technology. Gardening is associated both to health in terms of\n        therapeutics, but also as a way of living a healthy life. To this we are\n        interested both in how technology (sensors and automation) alter this\n        experience, as well as how we may take inspiration from gardening\n        practices and experiences into the design of digital technology. As for\n        technologies we are interested in:\n        <br></br>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <strong>Mixed reality </strong>\n            <br></br>\n            For this area we want to focus on possibilities of exploring ways of\n            developing augmented reality applications using virtual reality.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <strong>Applied AI </strong>\n            <br></br>\n            Exploring ways of using preexisting AI solutions in real world\n            applications.

Programming knowledge is required\n        and some prior experience developing applications is a bonus. You must\n        be fluent in spoken and written English.\n        <br></br>\n        <h2>Digital internship </h2>\n        The division of HCI is currently working remote due to the Covid 19\n        situation, and we have an established online work environment. The\n        entire internship will be done remotely with weekly Zoom meetings and\n        close communication via Slack. We expect to recruit 3-5 interns, which\n        means that there will be a small group that could have some internal\n        collaboration as well, depending on interest and topics. Our working\n        language is English. This is an unpaid internship.
